# Sampling

Here we have credit card dataset which tells whether the transactions are fraud or not. Here first I have converted this imbalanced dataset into balanced class dataset
using some techniques like Random Oversampling,Random Undersampling,Combined sampling(SMOTE),Adasyn sampling. then I have created five samples using various sampling tehniques like simple random sampling,cluster sampling,stratified sampling,systematic sampling,convenience sampling. Then I have applied five Machine Learning models on all the samples like AdaBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier,XGBClassifier and calculated accuracy for each case.
